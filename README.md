# Project-Lacuna

A space tactics game I am developing. Get the last prototype build from release section (windows): https://github.com/rbartsch/Project-Lacuna/releases

Need .NET Framework 4.0+ installed (should be included in Windows 7+ installs automatically).

The only real gameplay at the moment is simple trading between stations/systems.
